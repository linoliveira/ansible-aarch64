# Ansible Docker image for AArch64

This is the same image of [Ansible](https://hub.docker.com/r/ansible/ansible/) but replacing the [x86 Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) for the [AArch64 version of Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/r/aarch64/ubuntu/) to allow for AArch64 compatibility.

Please refer to the [official Ansible image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ansible/ansible/) for usage instructions.
